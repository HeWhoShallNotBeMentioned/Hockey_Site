# Hockey Site

#### NHL related blog, team stats, and daily schedule, 2/2/2016

#### By Chris Underwood

## Description

This is my end of class project for Epicodus. The hope is to show a range of skills as well as following programming best practices.
The site is in 3 parts: 1) a hockey related blog, 2) a team stats section, and 3) a daily schedule. Authentication is provided by the Devise gem.

Blog:

Consists of posts, comments, and tags. All users can view blog posts, comments, and tags. Authenticated users can all create new posts, comments, and tags. They can also click on a tag to see all posts with that tag. Admin users have the additional power of editing and deleting posts, comments, and tags.

Team Stats:

Must be an authenticated user to view stats. Column heading are sortable. Data is from live SportsRadar API using their testing database. There are currently 5 teams that can be chosen. If I ever go with live/accurate/pay data, will look to add other teams.

Daily Schedule:

This schedule is for all teams on the current day. Column headings are sortable. Data is from live SportsRadar API. Would eventually like to have the ability to search by a specific day.

API
 Currently Outbound only with just posts. URL: http://localhost:3000/api/posts Uses JSON.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Clone the repo to your local machine.
Start Postgres
rake db:setup (this will create the database and populate the database with data from seeds.rb)
localhost:3000 in your browser of choice

## Known Bugs

At this time, the application is believed to behave as designed. Please let me know if you find any bugs.

Integration tests are not working.
